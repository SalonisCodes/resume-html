            <b> Software Development Engineer Intern, Amazon Development Centre India Pvt Ltd <br/>
                Jul 2023 - Dec 2023<br/>
            <p> Project: IFS behind PayStation migration & IFS Integration Testsuite</b><br/>
                At Amazon, I worked on a critical project focused on the migration of the 
                IFS Payments Service from the existing Upstream Client behind a central authority 
                service PayStation, significantly enhancing scalability and security. I 
                implemented A/B testing methodologies to assess latency metrics and ensure the                 
                health of hosting infrastructure, contributing to the development of Central Payments 
                Client APIs using Java, and conducting a variety of tests, including unit tests,
                stress tests, and end-to-end tests. My responsibilities extended to the creation of 
                an Integration Testsuite, incorporating BDD code format, to validate the introduction 
                of new APIs within the IFS package.

            <p>Project: Environment Management System for ReMoNet IIoT with Ethernet Cloud Connectivity</b><br/>
                Our team was assigned the hardware integration for the ReMoNet Sensor Node 
                System, establishing critical connections and enabling Ethernet communication.
                My role involved programming a Texas Instruments Tiva C Series microcontroller 
                using the C language. We coordinated the seamless collection of data from                 
                Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Pressure sensors, directing the flow to an 
                Edge Computer collaboratively developed by a partner team for further data 
                processing and transmission. This experience honed my skills in embedded systems, 
                C programming, and teamwork, showcasing my proficiency in delivering efficient 
                solutions for complex IoT projects.
